# DS-ML-Resources
Data science and machine learning research and tools move quickly. This is a place to
attempt to keep a somewhat organized list of resources that I have found useful or look
interesting. Essentially a glorified bookmarks page that is hopefully better organized, and
has better descriptions.

## Research Papers
- arxiv, but better: [arxiv-sanity-preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)
- Google research: [link](https://ai.google/)
- FaceBook AI research [link](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/?page=1)

## State of the Art Models
- [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)

## Documentation Tools
- Creating graphical representations of cloud architecture with a Python package:
[diagrams.mingrammer](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/)
- Cookie cutter to have consistent and reasonable project structures for DS/ML projects:
[data-science-cookie-cutter](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science)

## Machine Learning Libraries
While these libraries are useful tools by themselves, they also provide great templates
for structuring code and projects
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    - [Keras](https://keras.io/)
        - Keras code examples: [link](https://keras.io/examples/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Model Explainability
- [Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)
- [Shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)

## Conferences
These would be interesting to attend, but also useful when looking for interesting youtube
videos.
- International Conference on Machine Learning [ICML](https://icml.cc/) 
- Neural Information Processing Systems [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/)
- International Conference on Learning Representations [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/)
- Conference in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition [CVPR](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/)
- Association for Computational Linguistics [ACL](https://acl2020.org/)

## Cloud Computing
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) While this is a cloud agnostic tool, it is very cloud
oriented.
